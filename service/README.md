##PE RATIO
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp

The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple.

P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time.

P/E Ratio = Market value per share / Earnings per share

##PEG RATIO

PEG Is The Price/Earnings to Growth Ratio and a stock valuation measure that investors and analysts can use to get a broad assessment of a companys performance and evaluate investment risk.

In theory, a PEG ratio value of 1 represents a perfect correlation between the company's market value and its projected earnings growth. PEG ratios higher than 1 are generally considered unfavorable, suggesting a stock is overvalued. Conversely, ratios lower than 1 are considered better, indicating a stock is undervalued.

###PEG = P/E / EGR (Earnings growth rate over five years)

##PB Ratio 
PB is used to compare a firms market cap to its book value. Calculated by dividing the companys stock price per share by its book value per share.

Book value is also the tangible net asset value of a company calculated as total assets minus intangible assets (.e.g. patents, goodwill) and liabilities.

P/B ratios under 1 are typically considered solid investments. A lower P/B ratio could mean the stock is undervalued or that something is fundamentally wrong with the company.

The P/B ratio measures the market's valuation of a company relative to its book value.

### P/B Ratio = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share

**The P/B ratio** reflects the value that market participants attach to a company's equity relative to the book value of its equity. 
A stock's market value is a forward-looking metric that reflects a company's future cash flows. 

**The book value of equity** is an accounting measure based on the historic cost principle and reflects past issuances of equity, augmented by any profits or losses, and reduced by dividends and share buybacks.

####The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value. The market value of a company is its share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. The book value is the net assets of a company.
In other words, if a company liquidated all of its assets and paid off all its debt, the value remaining would be the company's book value. (Assets - Debt)

The P/B ratio provides a valuable reality check for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price and is often looked at in conjunction with return on equity (ROE), a reliable growth indicator. **Large discrepancies between the P/B ratio and ROE often send up a red flag on companies**. Overvalued growth stocks frequently show a combination of low ROE and high P/B ratios. If a company's ROE is growing, its P/B ratio should also be growing.

any value under 1.0 is considered a good P/B for value investors, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors may often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0 as their benchmark.

Due to accounting conventions on the treatment of certain costs, the market value of equity is typically higher than the book value of a company, resulting in a P/B ratio above 1.0.
For Example Research and Development costs are expensed reducing a companies book value but market participants may raise the stock price due to these R&D efforts. resulting in wide differences
in market and book values of equity.


###Example
Assume that a company has $100 million in assets on the balance sheet and $75 million in liabilities. The book value of that company would be calculated simply as $25 million ($100M - $75M). If there are 10 million shares outstanding, each share would represent $2.50 of book value. If the share price is $5, then the P/B ratio would be 2x (5 / 2.50). This illustrates that the market price is valued at twice its book value.

##Return On Equity (ROE)
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp
**Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity.** Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is considered the return on net assets. ROE is considered a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficient it is in generating profits.

Return On Equity = Net Income / Average Shareholders Equity

**Net Income** - Found on Income Statement and is the amount of income, net expenses and taxes that a company generates for a given period.

**Average Shareholders Equity** - Adding Equity at the beginning of the period.

####A good ROE depends on what the norm is for that stocks peers. A good rule of thumb is to target an ROE that is equal or just above the average for that sector. A common shortcut for investors is to consider a return on equity near the long-term average of the S&P 500 (14%) as an acceptable ratio and anything less than 10% as poor.

**ROE can be used to estimate future growth** - 
**Multiple ROE by Retention Ratio(percentage of net income that is retained or reinvested by the company to fund future growth**

##Retention Ratio

The retention ratio is the proportion of earnings kept back in the business as retained earnings. The retention ratio refers to the percentage of net income that is retained to grow the business, rather than being paid out as dividends. It is the opposite of the payout ratio, which measures the percentage of profit paid out to shareholders as dividends. The retention ratio is also called the plowback ratio.

Retention Ratio = Retained Earnings / Net Income

####Important Note - The retention rate for technology companies in a relatively early stage of development is generally 100%, as they seldom pay dividends. But in mature sectors such as utilities and telecommunications, where investors expect a reasonable dividend, the retention ratio is typically quite low because of the high dividend payout ratio.

##Debt To Equity Ratio
The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. The D/E ratio is an important metric used in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds. More specifically, it reflects the ability of shareholder equity to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio.

Debt/Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholder Equity

Some industries, such as banking, are known for having much higher D/E ratios than others. 

**Note that a D/E ratio that is too low may actually be a negative signal, indicating that the firm is not taking advantage of debt financing to expand and grow.**

What Does a Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio of 1.5 Indicate?
A debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 would indicate that the company in question has $1.50 of debt for every $1 of equity. To illustrate, suppose the company had assets of $2 million and liabilities of $1.2 million. Because equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, the company’s equity would be $800,000. Its D/E ratio would therefore be $1.2 million divided by $800,000, or 1.5.

A higher D/E ratio may make it harder for a company to obtain financing in the future. This means that the firm may have a harder time servicing its existing debts. Very high D/Es can be indicative of a credit crisis in the future, including defaulting on loans or bonds, or even bankruptcy.

##Book Value Per Share (BVPS)
Book value per share (BVPS) is the ratio of equity available to common shareholders divided by the number of outstanding shares. This figure represents the minimum value of a company's equity and measures the book value of a firm on a per-share basis.

Book value per share (BVPS) takes the ratio of a firm's common equity divided by its number of shares outstanding.
Book value of equity per share effectively indicates a firm's net asset value (total assets - total liabilities) on a per-share basis.
When a stock is undervalued, it will have a higher book value per share in relation to its current stock price in the market.
BVPS is used mainly by stock investors to evaluate a company's stock price.

In theory, BVPS is the sum that shareholders would receive in the event that the firm was liquidated, all of the tangible assets were sold and all of the liabilities were paid. However, its value lies in the fact that investors use it to gauge whether a stock price is undervalued by comparing it to the firm's market value per share. If a company’s BVPS is higher than its market value per share, which is its current stock price, then the stock is considered undervalued.

###Market Value Per Share vs. Book Value Per Share
While BVPS is calculated using historical costs, the market value per share is a forward-looking metric that takes into account a company's future earning power. An increase in a company’s potential profitability or expected growth rate should increase the market value per share.

For example, a marketing campaign will reduce BVPS by increasing costs. However, if this builds brand value and the company is able to charge premium prices for its products, its stock price might rise far above its BVPS.
